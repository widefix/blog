Have you ever created your own __Rake tasks__? If you frequently create them, this post will prove to be quite valuable. I won't delve into what a __Rake task__ is since there is already an abundance of information available on the topic. However, I will provide you with a simple and efficient method for generating __Rake tasks__.

While working on another __Rake task__, I stumbled upon an intriguing generator in __Ruby on Rails__. What's surprising is that despite reading numerous posts, documentation, books, tutorials, and watching screencasts, I had never encountered it before. Even more astonishing is that I have never heard anyone mention it on any podcasts. I searched for information on this particular generator on Google but found nothing. As a result, I decided to share my findings here.

## Several ways to create Rake tasks

If you're interested in creating your own Rake task, there are two approaches you can take (or so I believed prior to this):

1. Write it from the ground up.
2. Copy and paste code from an existing __Rake task__ and modify it as necessary.


## The generator way to create Rake tasks

As it turns out, there is a third approach to creating __Rake tasks__ - by simply utilizing this __Rake generator__:

```shell
$ rails g task my_namespace my_task1 my_task2
```

It generates a scaffold for the new __Rake tasks__ located within the `lib/tasks/my_namespace.rake` file:

```ruby
namespace :my_namespace do
  desc "TODO"
  task :my_task1 => :environment do
  end

  desc "TODO"
  task :my_task2 => :environment do
  end
end
```

Now, once you have a starting point, write some code inside the __Rake tasks__. This way, you save some time creating the preparation code and can start with what matters.

Let's confirm that these __Rake tasks__ are present and can be executed:

```shell
$ rake -T | grep my_namespace
```

The command outputs the following content:

```shell
rake my_namespace:my_task1  # TODO
rake my_namespace:my_task2  # TODO
```

The output indicates that there are two Rake tasks defined under the namespace `my_namespace`: `my_task1` and `my_task2`. However, they are currently empty and will not do anything until you add code to them. The TODO comments are there to remind you to describe what these tasks do.

## Creating a Rake task has never been easier

As you can see, creating your own __Rake tasks__ is pretty easy. The generator provides a skeleton for you, saving you time. You only need to focus on the task behavior. Thanks for reading and happy coding!
