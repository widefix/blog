## Challenges in redesigning a Ruby on Rails app

Redesigning a Ruby on Rails application is a common challenge for many companies. It may not be an issue for web apps with no live users. But it can be tricky for already launched businesses serving thousands of users per day and generating revenue.

In the later scenario, the original application should continue functioning reliably while the new design gets validated and tested against the back-end. If the back-end is found to be incompatible, it must be adapted to fit the new design without breaking the old functionality. Setting aside other technical and human resource challenges, overcoming these common challenges is essential when dealing with a Ruby on Rails application redesign.
