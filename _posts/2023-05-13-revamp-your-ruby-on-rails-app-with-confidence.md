## Ruby on Rails app redesigning challenges

Redesigning a Ruby on Rails application is a common challenge for many companies. It may not be an issue for web apps with no live users. But it can be tricky for already launched businesses serving thousands of users per day and generating revenue.

In the latter scenario, the original application should continue functioning reliably while the new design gets validated and tested against the back-end. If the back-end is found to be incompatible, it must be adapted to fit the new design without breaking the old functionality. Setting aside other technical and human resource challenges, overcoming these common challenges is essential when dealing with a Ruby on Rails application redesign.

In this article, we will share our approach to applying a new design to a Ruby on Rails application with tens of thousands of active daily users, as experienced with one of our clients.

## Why redesigning a Ruby on Rails app

There are several reasons why an app may consider implementing a new UI/UX design. Regardless of the motive, the ultimate goal is always the same - **to increase revenue**. If the app is already in production, any effort put into improving its design should result in higher revenue. If a redesign does not have a positive impact on revenue, it may be seen as an unnecessary expense.

Minimizing expenses is crucial for achieving success. This means that any actions taken to implement a new design should not result in downtime that could lead to losing clients and revenue.

In our case, the client already had mockups drawn. Our task was to turn it into the code and connect it with the existing back-end. Technically, we had to avoid downtimes and reduce development efforts.
