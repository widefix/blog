## Ruby on Rails app redesigning challenges

Redesigning a Ruby on Rails application is a common challenge for many companies. While it may not be an issue for web apps without live users, it can be a tricky task for already launched businesses serving thousands of users per day.

In the latter scenario, the original application should continue functioning reliably while the new design gets validated and tested against the back-end. If the back-end is found to be incompatible, it must be adapted to the new design without breaking the old functionality. Setting aside other technical and human resource challenges, overcoming these common issues is essential when dealing with a Ruby on Rails application redesign.

In this article I will share the approach of applying the new design we took in one project. The changes we made increased the project revenue by 30%. As a side effect, we implemented an API that unleashed possibility to build a modern mobile application, made the code more fault-tolerance, performant, and stable.

## Why redesigning a Ruby on Rails app

There are several reasons why an app may consider implementing a new UI/UX design. Regardless of the motive, the ultimate goal is always the same - **to increase revenue**. Due to old and unhandy design, an app can have leaving customers. In this case redesign also can help.

If the app is already in production, any effort put into improving its design should result in higher revenue. If a redesign does not have a positive impact on revenue, it may be seen as an unnecessary expense.

Minimizing expenses is crucial for achieving success. This means that any actions taken to implement a new design should not result in downtime that could lead to losing clients and revenue.

## What is the new design

A new design is a set of screens (mockups) prepared by a specialist (designer) using some special software, like Figma, Adobe Photoshop, etc.

In our case, the client already had the mockups of the new design. Our task was to turn it into the code and connect it with the existing back-end. Technically, our task was to eliminate downtimes during the transition to the new design and reduce the development efforts.

## Different technical approaches of a Ruby on Rails app redesign

Nowadays, it's hard to imagine a web project that isn't responsive (doesn't look good in all browsers, including mobile ones) and doesn't have a mobile application. As a rule of thumb, modern web app design has a rich UI, with many elements located on one page, usually not connected to each other in any way.

To fulfill these requirements, adopting an architecture with a separate front-end/mobile app connected to the back-end via API is a recommended approach. Furthermore, to ensure seamless and easy-to-maintain communication between the front-end and back-end, we prefer utilizing **GraphQL**.

Usually, in a Ruby On Rails applications front-end code lives alongside the back-end one, when the front-end code is generated by Ruby. While this implementation can fullfill all modern web app requiremens and it's cheap in the beginning, it becomes hard with its maintainance. It's because of the tech overhead and mix of different technologies at one place (Ruby/JavaScript/HTML/CSS). It becomes too hard to find a developer that can understand and futher maintain this kind of system. And even if you find one, they might be too expensive. Also it will be hard to build a diversified team with many developers that are equally good with all these technologies (so-called full-stack devs).

Considering all these possible challenges for the client, we prefer separate back-end and front-end, where the different specialists are at their places. They do the job well on their ends. They do that fast with high quality. They are easily replaceable. Hence, there is no a bottleneck in some very specific specialist demand.

## Risk-free approach of a Ruby on Rails app redesign

The initial state of the project when we got it was looking like that:
- It's a usual Ruby On Rails application.
- With Rest API implemented on Grape. The API is consumed by an iOS mobile app.
- Web site version uses ERB and Slim templates that are generated on server by Ruby. UI is from the previous decade.
- Some dynamic features on the Web use Knockout.js (a JS framework that's not maintained anymore).

For the new UI we took Next.js framework with TypeScript and implemented GraphQL for API. To avoid possible errors on the main app, we created a separate repository for the new UI. If the GraphQL API needed some functionality that was already in use we carefully extracted the pieces of code to a service layer of the app so that the classes are reused in both places the old app and the new UI. All this story took almost 1 year of 2 devs and 1 project manager.

When it came to deploy the changes we put CloudFront (AWS service) as proxy on top of the old app and gradually switched web requests dispatching from the old app to the new one using a feature flag.

## Our results of the Ruby on Rails app redesign

After the switching to the new design the project became more attractive to users and there were more signups started. The old users were better satisfied with the app that allowed to encrease their charge by 20%. In summary the revenue increased by 30%.

The redesign expences were paid of within the first 3 months after the release.

Below are the results of paid users dynamics analysis for the whole story of the project:

The release date was 1st of February 2021.
