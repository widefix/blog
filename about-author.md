My name is Andrei Kaleshka. I have been working with Ruby/Rails since 2009. I am passionate about clean software architecture, code performance, readability, simplicity, and maintainability. This allows me to build applications with minimal cost but maximum results. I am the sole author of the book [Rake Task Management Essentials](https://www.packtpub.com/product/rake-task-management-essentials/9781783280773).

I am also the founder of [WideFix](https://widefix.com), a custom software development company that specializes in optimizing and maintaining web apps primarily written in Ruby on Rails. Checkout the company [officail page](https://widefix.com) to learn more about our services.

Want to talk? [Schedule](https://calendly.com/andrei-kaleshka/30min) a meeting with me.
